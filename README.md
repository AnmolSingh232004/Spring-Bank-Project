This project is a Java-Spring-Boot based project.
It simulates a bank having capabilites to add, remove, update bank accounts.
It uses PostgreSQL to store bank accounts.
Every account has :
id(primarKey) autogenerated, 
name,
email(cant be repeated),
registrationDate(autogenerated using LocalDate of system),
phoneNumber(cant be repeated),
balance(with proper logic for withdrawl and adding money)

Added logging capabilities in second push.

Bug found 2024/02/24
In the BankRepository interface, the query to find an existing user with phoneNumber
was not comparing with existing user's phone number but with his email.
FIXED!
